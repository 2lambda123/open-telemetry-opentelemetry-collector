receivers:
  # The following demonstrates initializing the default jaeger receiver.
  # By default all three protocols (grpc, thrift-http, thrift-tchannel)
  # are enabled and the default endpoints are specified in factory.go
  jaeger:
  # The following demonstrates specifying different ports.
  # The Jaeger receiver only connects to ports and ignores addresses.
  # However, an address is needed to specify for a proper configuration.
  # Ex: `endpoint: "9876"` is incorrect
  # Ex: `endpoint: "1.2.3.4:9876"` is correct
  jaeger/customname:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: "127.0.0.1:9876"
      thrift-http:
        endpoint: "127.0.0.1:3456"
      thrift-tchannel:
        endpoint: "0.0.0.0:123"

  # The following demonstrates disabling the receiver.
  # All of the protocols need to be disabled for the receiver to be disabled.
  # If only one protocol is disabled, that is ignored and the protocol is
  # enabled.
  # This is to be fixed with issue
