  # CheckInterval is the time between measurements of memory usage for the

  # MemoryLimitMiB is the maximum amount of memory, in MiB, targeted to be
  # allocated by the process.

  # MemorySpikeLimitMiB is the maximum, in MiB, spike expected between the
  # measurements of memory usage.

  # MemoryLimitPercentage is the maximum amount of memory, in %, targeted to be
  # allocated by the process. The fixed memory settings MemoryLimitMiB has a higher precedence.

  # MemorySpikePercentage is the maximum, in percents against the total memory,
