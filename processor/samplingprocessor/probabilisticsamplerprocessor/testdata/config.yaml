  # The probabilistic_sampler sets trace sampling by hashing the trace id of
  # each span and making the sampling decision based on the hashed value. It
  # also implements the "sampling.priority" semantic convention as defined by
  # OpenTracing. See
  # https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/semantic_conventions.md#span-tags-table
  # The "sampling.priority" semantics have priority over trace id hashing and
  # can be used to control if given spans are sampled, ie.: forwarded, or not.
  probabilistic_sampler:
    # the percentage rate at which traces are going to be sampled. Defaults to
    # zero, i.e.: no sample. Values greater or equal 100 are treated as
    # "sample all traces".
    sampling_percentage: 15.3
    # hash_seed allows one to configure the hashing seed. This is important in
    # scenarios where multiple layers of collectors have different sampling
    # rates: if all layers use the same seed, all data passing one layer may
    # pass the next even if they have different sampling rates. Having different
    # seeds at different layers avoid that problem.
