  # The following specifies the values of attribute `db.svc`, `operation`,
  # and `id` will form the new name of the span, in that order, separated by the
  # value `::`.
  # Note: There is no default configuration for a span-rename. The field `keys`
  # is required.
  # Example:
  # Attributes Key/Value pair
  # { "db.svc": "location:, "operation": "get", "id": "1234"}
  # Separator: "::"
  # Results in the following new span name:
  #   "location::get::1234"
  span-rename/custom:
    separator: "::"
    keys: [db.svc, operation, id]

  # The following specifies generating a span name with no separator.
  # Example:
  # Attributes Key/Value pair
  # { "db.svc": "location:, "operation": "get", "id": "1234"}
  # Separator: ""
  # Results in the following new span name:
  #   "locationget1234"
  span-rename/no-separator:
