  Instead of relying on the enabled `retry_on_failure` option, we now have a new option
  `sending_queue::requeue_on_failure` to control the requeuing independently of the retry sender. This can be useful
  for users who don't want the blocking exponential retry and just want to put the failed request back in the queue.
  This option can also be enabled with the memory queue now, which means that the data will never be dropped after
  getting to the queue as long as the collector is up and running.
  
  IMPORTANT: Make sure to set `sending_queue::requeue_on_failure` to `true` if you use persistent queue with 
  `retry_on_failure` enabled to preserve the same behavior.
