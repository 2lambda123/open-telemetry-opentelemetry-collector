  Instead of relying or enabled `retry_on_failure` option, we now have a new option
  to control the re-enqueue independently of the retry sender. This can be useful 
  for users who don't want the blocking exponential retry, just want to put the 
  failed request in beginning of the queue. Also this option can be enabled with 
  memory queue, which means that the data will never be dropped after getting 
  to the queue as long as the collector is up and running.
