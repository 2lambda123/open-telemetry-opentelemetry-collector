  Most Collector builds do not use cgo, and all upstream distributions explicitly disable it.
  Set `distribution::cgo_enabled` to `true` to allow use of cgo. Note that setting `cgo_enabled`
  will only not set the `CGO_ENABLED` variable, and may not necessarily enable cgo.
  See the [cgo package docs](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo) for more information.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
