  The following experimental API is introduced in exporter/exporterhelper package:
    - `WithRequestQueue`: a new exporter helper option for using a queue.
    - queue.Queue: an interface for queue implementations.
    - queue.Factory: a queue factory interface, implementations of this interface are intended to be used with WithRequestQueue option.
    - queue.Settings: queue factory settings.
    - queue.Config: common configuration for queue implementations.
    - queue.NewDefaultConfig: a function for creating a default queue configuration.
    - queue/memoryqueue.NewFactory: a new factory for creating a memory queue.
    - queue/memoryqueue.Config: a configuration for the memory queue factory.
    - queue/memoryqueue.NewDefaultConfig: a function for creating a default memory queue configuration.
    - request.ErrorHandler: an optional interface for handling errors that occur during request processing.
    - request.Marshaler: a function that can marshal a Request into bytes.
    - request.Unmarshaler: a function that can unmarshal bytes into a Request
    All the new APIs are intended to be used by exporters that operate over client-provided requests instead of pdata.
