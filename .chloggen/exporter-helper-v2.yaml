  The following experimental API is introduced in exporter/exporterhelper package:
    - `RequestMarshaler`: a new interface for marshaling client-provided requests.
    - `RequestUnmarshaler`: a new interface for unmarshaling client-provided requests.
    - `WithMemoryQueue`: a new exporter helper option for using a memory queue.
    - `WithPersistentQueue`: a new exporter helper option for using a persistent queue.
    - `QueueConfig`: a configuration for queueing requests used by WithMemoryQueue option. 
    - `NewDefaultQueueConfig`: a function for creating a default QueueConfig.
    - `PersistentQueueConfig`: a configuration for queueing requests in persistent storage used by WithPersistentQueue option.
    - `NewDefaultPersistentQueueConfig`: a function for creating a default PersistentQueueConfig.
    All the new APIs are intended to be used by exporters that operate over client-provided requests instead of pdata.
