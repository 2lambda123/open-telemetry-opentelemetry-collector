# Overview

The project has continuous project management needs to ensure that issues and PRs are routed appropriately and handled in a timely manner. To ensure this happens there is a rotating role of project manager. The role currently rotates once a week. It is not the job of the project manager to personally handle all these issues but to ensure the right people are engaged and that issues are handled in a timely manner.

## Responsibilities

* Monitor [Gitter](https://gitter.im/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-service) and respond or delegate for someone to respond
* Assign any unassigned PRs or issues to the appropriate party
  * [core](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+no%3Aassignee)
  * [contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues?q=is%3Aopen+no%3Aassignee)
* Ensure Collector milestones are up-to-date (both adding and removing items)
  * [core](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/milestones)
  * [contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/milestones)
* Ensure [project board](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/projects/3) is up-to-date
* Ensure someone runs the weekly [Collector SIG meeting](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#agentcollector)
* Ensure a release is cut on Tuesday if it is a release week

## Open questions

* Do we want to establish some sort of best-effort SLA for getting things reviewed, triaged, etc.?
