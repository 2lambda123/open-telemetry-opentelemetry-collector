Exports data to the console (stderr) via `zap.Logger`.

See also the [Troubleshooting][troubleshooting_docs] document for examples on using this exporter.

[troubleshooting_docs]: ../../docs/troubleshooting.md

## Getting Started

The following settings are optional:

- `verbosity` (default = `basic`): the verbosity of the logging export
  (detailed|normal|basic). When set to `detailed`, pipeline data is verbosely
  logged.
- `sampling_initial` (default = `2`): number of messages initially logged each
  second.
- `sampling_thereafter` (default = `1`): sampling rate after the initial
  messages are logged (every Mth message is logged).
  The default value of `1` means that sampling is disabled.
  To enable sampling, change `sampling_thereafter` to a value higher than `1`.
  Refer to [Zap docs](https://godoc.org/go.uber.org/zap/zapcore#NewSampler) for more details
  on how sampling parameters impact number of messages.
- `use_internal_logger` (default = `true`): uses the collector's internal logger for output. See [below](#using-the-collectors-internal-logger) for description.

Example configuration:

```yaml
exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed
    sampling_initial: 5
    sampling_thereafter: 200
```

## Verbosity levels

The following subsections describe the output from the exporter depending on the configured verbosity level - `basic`, `normal` and `detailed`.
The default verbosity level is `basic`.

### Basic verbosity

With `verbosity: basic`, the exporter outputs a single-line summary of received data with a total count of telemetry records for every batch of received logs, metrics or traces.

Here's an example output:

```console
2023-11-10T22:49:03.510-0600    info    TracesExporter  {"kind": "exporter", "data_type": "traces", "name": "debug", "resource spans": 1, "spans": 2}
```

### Normal verbosity

With `verbosity: normal`, the exporter outputs about one line for each telemetry record.
The "one line per telemetry record" is not a strict rule.
For example, logs with multiline body will be output as multiple lines.

Here's an example output:

```console
2024-06-24T15:18:58.559+0200    info    TracesExporter  {"kind": "exporter", "data_type": "traces", "name": "debug", "resource spans": 1, "spans": 2}
2024-06-24T15:18:58.559+0200    info    okey-dokey-0 4bdc558f0f0650e3ccaac8f3ae133954 8b69459f015c164b net.peer.ip=1.2.3.4 peer.service=telemetrygen-client
lets-go 4bdc558f0f0650e3ccaac8f3ae133954 8820ee5366817639 net.peer.ip=1.2.3.4 peer.service=telemetrygen-server
        {"kind": "exporter", "data_type": "traces", "name": "debug"}
```

### Detailed verbosity

With `verbosity: detailed`, the exporter outputs all details of every telemetry record, typically writing multiple lines for every telemetry record.

Here's an example output:

```console
2023-11-10T22:49:03.510-0600    info    TracesExporter  {"kind": "exporter", "data_type": "traces", "name": "debug", "resource spans": 1, "spans": 2}

```

## Using the collector's internal logger

When `use_internal_logger` is set to `true` (the default), the exporter uses the collector's [internal logger][internal_telemetry] for output.
This comes with several consequences:

1. The exporter's output is prefixed and suffixed by the internal logger's data.
   - The prefix is the current timestamp and the `info` level marker, similar to `2023-11-10T22:49:03.510-0600    info`
   - The suffix is the exporter's metadata in JSON format, similar to `{"kind": "exporter", "data_type": "traces", "name": "debug"}`
1. The exporter's output is sent to the same destination as the collector's logs. By default, it is the [standard error][stderr] stream,
   configurable via the [service::telemetry::logs::output_paths][configure_internal_logs] option.
   It is not possible to send the Debug exporter's output to a different stream than the collector's internal logs.
1. The output from the Debug exporter is sent to the internal logger with the log level `INFO`.
   This means that if user configures the `service::telemetry::logs::level` to `WARN` or `ERROR`,
   they will not see the output from the Debug exporter.
   As a result, it is not possible to configure the collector to see the Debug exporter's output
   and mute collector's INFO logs at the same time.
1. The exporter's output is subject to the internal logger's sampling,
   which is separate from the sampling defined in the exporter's configuration.
   See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/9921 and the note in the "Workaround" section of the issue.

When `use_internal_logger` is set to `false`, the exporter uses its own logger, independent from the collector's internal logger. This results in the following behavior:

1. The prefix and suffix described above is not present in the exporter's output.
1. The exporter's output is sent to [standard output][stdout] stream. This will be made configurable in the future. Changing the value of `service::telemetry::logs::output_paths` has no effect on the exporter's output.
1. Changing the value of `service::telemetry::logs::level` has no effect on the exporter's output.
1. The exporter's sampling is defined by the exporter's configuration options `sampling_initial` and `sampling_thereafter` and nothing else. The configuration in `service::telemetry::logs::sampling` has no effect on the exporter's output.
